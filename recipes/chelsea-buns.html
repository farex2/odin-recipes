        <h2>Description</h2>
        <h3>Chelsea buns are sweet rolls, filled with raisins or currants and rolled up like bread</h3>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p><ul>
            <li>2 (.25 ounce) envelopes active dry yeast</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup warm water</li>
                
            <li>6 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                
            <li>¾ cup butter</li>
                
            <li>1 ½ cups milk</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup white sugar, divided</li>
                
            <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
                
            <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
                
            <li>1 cup raisins</li>
                
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
                
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <p><ol>
            <li><p>Sprinkle the yeast over 1/4 cup of warm water in a small bowl and stir in 1 teaspoon</p><p> of sugar. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand</p> <p> for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam.</p></li>
            <li><p>Sift together the flour and salt. Cut in 3/4 cup butter with a knife or pastry blender</p> <p> until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Bring the milk to a boil; remove from the </p> <p>heat and stir in 1/2 cup sugar. Cool until the milk is lukewarm, no more than 100 </p><p>degrees F (40 degrees C). Pour the milk and yeast mixture into the flour. Add the eggs </p> <p>and mix well to form a soft, sticky dough.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, </p><p>about 8 minutes. Add more flour a tablespoon at a time, if necessary. Place the dough </p><p>in a buttered bowl, turning to coat the dough. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a </p><p>warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 </p><p>1/2 hours.</p></li>
            <li><p>Roll the dough into a square on a floured surface. Brush the dough with the melted </p><p>butter and sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup sugar and the raisins. Roll up the </p><p>dough to form a log, pinching the seam to seal</p>.</li>
            <li><p>Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan.</p></li>
            <li><p>Cut the log into slices about 1 1/2 inches thick. Place the slices in the prepared pan </p><p>and let them rise for 30 minutes. Beat the egg yolk with 2 tablespoons of water to </p><p>form an egg wash. Brush the buns with egg wash.</p></li>
            <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven until the buns are golden brown and the centers are set, </p><p>about 25 minutes.</p></li>
            </ol></p>
